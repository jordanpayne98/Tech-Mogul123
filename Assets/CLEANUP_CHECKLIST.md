# Cleanup Checklist

## File to Delete Manually

**Unused tooltip helper class:**
- `/Assets/UI/UIToolkit/EmployeeGrowthTooltip.cs`
- `/Assets/UI/UIToolkit/EmployeeGrowthTooltip.cs.meta`

**Reason:** Created but never implemented. Was meant to show tooltips on hover, but not connected to any UI.

**How to delete:**
1. In Unity Project window
2. Navigate to `Assets/UI/UIToolkit/`
3. Right-click `EmployeeGrowthTooltip.cs`
4. Select "Delete"
5. Unity will automatically remove the .meta file
